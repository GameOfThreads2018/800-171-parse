# README - Coding Exercise

## Solution
For the solution, I was unable to get the proper format in alotted time. However, I was able to get the base script for parsing the csv into JSON object.
Code is contained in parse.py script and it can be execute via command line or IDE, for my implementation I used Visual Studio. Either way, there will be a prompt that will cue the user to input a filepath, Input file is required to be csv with the same data format as provided in the data folder of this project.
